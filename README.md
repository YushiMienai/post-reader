## Task

- Create a simple post reader as a React SPA.
- Implement above using React components and CSS3.
- Retrieve the data shown in the app from the API described below.
- Concentrate on functionality, code quality (CSS and JS/TS) and testability, not design.
- Any common state management, routing and/or testing library can be used.
- Using CSS toolkits and UI frameworks (bootstrap etc) is not ok. The purpose is to evaluate your coding skills, not npm skills.

Must haves:
- Login Screen with email and name inputs.
- Sender list with sender name and post count ordered by name alphabetically.
- Clicking on a sender opens that sender's posts in the post list view.
- Post list where posts are ordered by creation time.
- Post order buttons to allow choosing most recent first and most recent last ordering for posts list

Nice to haves:
- Search box for senders. Any senders whose name do not contain the text entered are hidden
- Search box for posts. Any posts that do not contain the text entered are hidden
- Deep-linkable post list. This means that it is possible to enter a URL that directly selects the sender whose posts are shown.

## Rough Design
